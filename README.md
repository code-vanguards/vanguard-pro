# Vanguard Pro
> Developed for the Seneca Digital Health Hackathon 2021.

A web app that helps the user to be more productive and have fun at the same time. The user may earn points, get achievements, unlock new features and build streaks. It can gather data from the userâ€™s gaming platform (initially Steam) via API to send alerts and may warn the player if they have exceeded their allotted playtime.
